# Autonomous Website Exploration and Testing
Agent, using training data from Agent-X, learns how to explore a website and evaluate its fields, forms, and functions. Agents, when not exploring, automatically apply abstract test flows, written in a standard grammar and learned by example, to determine if the site is operating in a consistent manner. Message queues and a coordinator support multiple distributed and concurrent Agents, thus enabling the rapid evaluation of new web applications.
